Well...
## VNE
**VNE** is a VisualNovelEngine on C# and .NET 3.5... 
VNE is fully open source.
## How to work with VNE?
1. Clone the repo and open solution via Visual Studio 2022 with installed C# lang with .NET 3.5
1.1 Compile the solution and put files from `sln_path/bin/release/` which called VisualNovelEngine.exe and .pdb into your game.
2. Create in your game root two folders. Scritps and Characters.
3. In script folder put file named intro.txt
   **It will be your start script.**


## VNE SCRIPT SYNTAXIS
`define CharName Characters/char.png(jfif, jpg, jpeg)` - This will define your character's name and sprites.</br>
`dialog CharName normal Halo! im emu otori!!!` - Will show your char and dialogue: Halo! Im emu otori!</br>
`script load day1.txt` - Will load new script from your Scritps folder</br>


## That's all!

VNE still in development and being developed from scratch.
I would be thankful if you will notify me about bugs in Issue Tracker.
